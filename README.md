# EigenPro3: Fast training of large kernel models

*General kernel models* are predictors of the form
$$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i K(x,z_i)$$
where $z_i$ are model centers, which can be arbitrary, i.e., they need not be a subset of the training data. EigenPro3 requires only $O(p)$ memory, and can use multiple GPUs.

The algorithm is based on Projected dual-preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent. A derivation is given in this paper  
**Title:** [Toward Large Kernel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02605) (2023)  
**Authors:** Amirhesam Abedsoltan, Mikhail Belkin, Parthe Pandit.  
**TL;DR:** [Recent studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13881) indicate kernel machines can perform similarly or better than deep neural networks (DNNs) on small datasets. The interest in kernel machines has been additionally bolstered by their equivalence to wide neural networks. However, a key feature of DNNs is their ability to scale the model size and training data size independently, whereas in traditional kernel machines the model size is tied to the data size. EigenPro3 provides a way forward for constructing large-scale *general kernel models* that decouple the model and training data.

## Demo on CIFAR-10 dataset
Set an environment variable `DATA_DIR='/path/to/dataset/'` where the file `cifar-10-batches-py` can be found. Otherwise download the data using
### Downloading Data
```python
from torchvision.datasets import CIFAR10
import os
CIFAR10(os.environ['DATA_DIR'], train=True, download=True)
```
### Train Laplacian kernel model using EigenPro
```python
import torch
from eigenpro3.utils import accuracy, load_dataset
from eigenpro3.datasets import CustomDataset
from eigenpro3.models import KernelModel
from eigenpro3.kernels import laplacian, ntk_relu

p = 5000 # model size

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    DEVICES = [torch.device(f'cuda:{i}') for i in range(torch.cuda.device_count())]
else:
    DEVICES = [torch.device('cpu')]

kernel_fn = lambda x, z: laplacian(x, z, bandwidth=20.0)
# kernel_fn = lambda x, z: ntk_relu(x, z, depth=2)

n_classes, (X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = load_dataset('cifar10')

centers = X_train[torch.randperm(X_train.shape[0])[:p]]

testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    CustomDataset(X_test, y_test.argmax(-1)), batch_size=512,
    shuffle=False, pin_memory=True)

model = KernelModel(n_classes, centers, kernel_fn, X=X_train, y=y_train, devices=DEVICES)
model.fit(model.train_loaders, testloader, score_fn=accuracy, epochs=20)
```
## Tutorial to train in a batched manner
Refer to the [FashionMNIST_batched.ipynb](https://github.com/EigenPro/EigenPro3/blob/main/demos/FashionMNIST_batched.ipynb) tutorial where you can use your own dataloader.
# Limitations of EigenPro2
[EigenPro2](https://github.com/EigenPro/EigenPro-pytorch) can only train models of the form $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i K(x,x_i)$$ where $x_i$ are $n$ training samples. This can be hard to train if $n$ is very large.

## Algorithm details
EigenPro3 solves the optimization problem,
$$\underset{f\in\mathcal{H}}{\text{argmin}}\quad \sum_{i=1}^n (f(x_i)-y_i)^2 \quad \text{s.t.}\quad f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i K(x,z_i)\qquad\forall x$$
    
It applies a dual preconditioner, one for the model and one for the data. It applies a projected-preconditioned SGD
$$f^{t+1}=\textrm{proj}_C(f^t - \eta\mathcal{P}(\nabla L(f^t)))$$
where $\nabla L$ is a Fr√©chet derivative, $\mathcal{P}$ is a preconditioner, and $\textrm{proj}_C$ is a projection operator onto the model space.
